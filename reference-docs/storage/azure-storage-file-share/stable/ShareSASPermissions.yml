  This is a helper class to construct a string representing the permissions
  granted by a ServiceSAS to a share.

  Setting a value to true means that any SAS which uses these permissions will
  grant permissions for that operation.

  Once all the values are set, this should be serialized with toString and set
  as the permissions field on a

  <xref:@azure/storage-file-share.FileSASSignatureValues|stable> object. It is
  possible to construct the permissions string without this class, but

  the order of the permissions is particular and this class guarantees
  correctness.
