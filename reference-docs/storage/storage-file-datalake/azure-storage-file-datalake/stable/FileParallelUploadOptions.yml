      The umask restricts the permissions of the file to be created.

      u is the umask.

      For example, if p is 0777 and u is 0057, then the resulting permission is
      0720.

      The default permission is 0666 for a file. The default umask is 0027.

      The umask must be specified in 4-digit octal notation (e.g. 0766).
