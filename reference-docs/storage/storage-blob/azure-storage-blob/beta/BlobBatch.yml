      The deleteBlob operation marks the specified blob or snapshot for
      deletion.

      The blob is later deleted during garbage collection.

      Only one kind of operation is allowed per batch request.

      Note that in order to delete a blob, you must delete all of its snapshots.

      You can delete both at the same time. See [delete operation
      details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/delete-blob).

      The operation will be authenticated and authorized with specified
      credential.

      See [blob batch authorization
      details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/blob-batch#authorization).

      The setBlobAccessTier operation sets the tier on a blob.

      The operation is allowed on block blobs in a blob storage or general

      Only one kind of operation is allowed per batch request.

      A block blob's tier determines Hot/Cool/Archive storage type.

      This operation does not update the blob's ETag.
