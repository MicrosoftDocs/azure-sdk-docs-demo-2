      May produce better and more readable text extraction from PDF files that
      have rotated text within them.  Note that there may be a small performance
      speed impact when this parameter is used.  This parameter only applies to
      PDF files, and only to PDFs with embedded text.  If the rotated text
      appears within an embedded image in the PDF, this parameter does not
      apply.
