    summary: >-
      Defaults to 0. Maximum value of 5. Denotes the acceptable number of
      divergent characters that would still constitute a match with the entity
      name. The smallest possible fuzziness for any given match is returned. For
      instance, if the edit distance is set to 3, "Windows10" would still match
      "Windows", "Windows10" and "Windows 7". When case sensitivity is set to
      false, case differences do NOT count towards fuzziness tolerance, but
      otherwise do.
