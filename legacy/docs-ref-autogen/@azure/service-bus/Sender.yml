  The Sender class can be used to send messages, schedule messages to be sent at
  a later time

  and cancel such scheduled messages.

  Use the `createSender` function on the QueueClient or TopicClient to
  instantiate a Sender.

  The Sender class is an abstraction over the underlying AMQP sender link.

      Opens the AMQP link to Azure Service Bus from the sender.

      It is not necessary to call this method in order to use the sender. It is

      recommended to call this before your first send() or sendBatch() call if
      you

      want to front load the work of setting up the AMQP link to the service.

      Schedules given message to appear on Service Bus Queue/Subscription at a

      Please note that you need to explicitly encode the message body if you
      intend to receive the message using a tool or library other than this
      library.

      For example:
       1. Import DefaultDataTransformer and instantiate.
           ```js
             const dt = new DefaultDataTransformer();
           ```
       2. Use the `encode` method on the transformer to encode the message body before calling the scheduleMessage() method
           ```js
             message.body = dt.encode(message.body);
           ```

          You will need the sequence number if you intend to cancel the
          scheduling of the message.

          Save the `Long` type as-is in your application without converting to
          number. Since JavaScript

          only supports 53 bit numbers, converting the `Long` to number will
          cause loss in precision.
